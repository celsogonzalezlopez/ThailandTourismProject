# ThailandTourismProject
    
    After looking through datasets for our project, we found one on Thailand’s tourism industry that we felt could produce
various insights. Thailand is a popular tourist destination and had a record-level year in 2019 for tourists. We sought to
understand what level of an effect COVID had on tourism and how they’ve recovered from it thus far. Additionally, we
wanted to understand how different tourists affected the tourism industry overall.
    Being from a government website, we determined this data was credible. Its variables included hotel occupancy rate,
number of tourists, and revenue from tourists.We first processed that data by removing nulls and making sure the
correct data types were used.Using SQL, we analyzed the data to identify patterns and draw conclusions. Tableau assisted
us in bringing that data to life and communicating our findings.
